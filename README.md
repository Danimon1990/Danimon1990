- - 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel, a passionate tech enthusiast.
- 👀 Human Nature Tech
- 🌱 I work with small farmers’ communities in Southern Illinois.
- ⚡ Weird fact: I was a psychotherapist who fell in love with technology and innovation. My journey began in psychology till I got my master’s degree in the Bologna University in Italy. My passion for visuals made me turn into graphic design and UX/UI, which naturally led me to coding for web and mobile applications. Along the way, I dove into **Python** and **AI** fundamentals to bring data-driven insights to my projects.

- **iOS Apps:** 🍏 Currently working on 6 iOS apps (in review for the App Store).
- **AI & Python:** Experimenting with NLP, image recognition, and training custom models.

**User-Centric:** My background in psychology and design ensures that every project starts with a deep understanding of user needs.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a polyglot in both code and languages (Python-Swift-JavaScript) and (English-Spanish-Italian).
